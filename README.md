Microformat Extractor
=====================

Microformat Extractor is a simple PHP5 tool kit for extracting common microformats from a page. 
The page can be presented as a string or a URL, and the result is handed back as a standard PHP array structure. 
Microformat Extractor is derived from hkit and uses SimpleXML for parsing, and therefore requires PHP5.


Usages
======

One example php file is included. For usages; see : http://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page
This is the standard Microformat Extractor which Google has implemented now.
You can use the library for development of other projects; such as WordPress Plugin to test a webpage for your
microformat related plugin development's output.
